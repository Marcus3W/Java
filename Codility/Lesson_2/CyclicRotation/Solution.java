/**
 * An array A consisting of N integers is given. Rotation of the array means that each element is shifted right by one index,
 * and the last element of the array is moved to the first place.
 *
 * For example, the rotation of array A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] is [6, 3, 8, 9, 7]
 * (elements are shifted right by one index and 6 is moved to the first place).
 *
 * The goal is to rotate array A K times; that is, each element of A will be shifted to the right K times.
 *
 * Assume that:
 * N and K are integers within the range [0..100];
 * each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’1,000..1,000].
